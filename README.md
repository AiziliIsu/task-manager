Project Description:
This project is a Task Manager application built using Spring Boot. It allows users to manage tasks by performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The application also includes Math and String utility features, where users can perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and string manipulations (reversing, counting vowels and consonants, and case conversion).

Key Features:
Task Management:

Create, view, update, and delete tasks.
Each task contains an id, name, description, and completed status.
Math Operations:

Perform basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
String Operations:

Reverse strings.
Count vowels and consonants in a string.
Convert the case of a string (upper to lower and vice versa).


Create Task (POST Request):
Here, we are sending a POST request with task information such as id, name, description, and completed status to create a new task in the application.
